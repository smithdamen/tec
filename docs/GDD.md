# TEC – GDD

## High Concept
Post-collapse survival sandbox: learn-by-doing, deep crafting, PVP with safe zones, seed-based world.

## Pillars
1. Survival (hunger, thirst, exposure)  2. Crafting depth & player economy
3. Server-authoritative simulation (10Hz tick)  4. Text-first client → GUI later

## Early Loop
Explore → Forage → Craft (hand axe, campfire, water container) → Shelter → Trade.
