# Working with the Assistant

- **Open a GitHub Issue** per task with:
  - Context: what/why in a few sentences.
  - Acceptance criteria: bullet list of observable behavior.
  - Affected modules: e.g., `server/protocol`, `client/tcod_client`.

- **Use PRs** to land changes. Keep them small and focused.

- **In chat**, share:
  - Exact error logs.
  - The diff for files you changed (or say “file replaced” and paste full file content).
  - The acceptance criteria you’re targeting.

- **After merge**, add a short note to `docs/DEVLOG/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with what changed and why.
