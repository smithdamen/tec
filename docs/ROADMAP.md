# TEC Roadmap (rolling)

## âœ… Done (Sep 2025)
- Server-auth ticks & protocol
- Roguelike input + centered viewport
- FOV: Euclidean, day/night radius, explored memory
- CI: ruff/mypy/pytest; guardrail tests

## Now
- Refactor all code in repository to include code commenting and very detailed documentation
- Update all docs according to requirements
- Needs UI: hunger/thirst/exposure bars; server decays needs per tick
- Items + pickup (`g`): place item on map; inventory on server

## Next
- Resource tiles in mapgen: trees, water, stone, fiber, scrap
- Simple craft: hand axe, campfire, container
- Hamlets (safe zones) with NPCs and a vendor

## Later
- Auth/sessions; persistence (world & characters)
- Lighting levels and multiple light sources
- Latency compensation & reconciliation
