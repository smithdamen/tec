# TEC Roadmap (rolling)

## Now
- FOV: server-side shadowcasting, client shows only visible tiles.
- Sidebar needs bars: hunger, thirst, exposure (decreasing over time).
- Items + PICKUP action (`g`) and simple item on map.

## Next
- Resource mapgen: trees/water/stone/fiber/scrap.
- Craft: hand axe, campfire, water container.
- Hamlets (safe zones) with NPCs and a vendor.
- Configurable keymap per user.

## Later
- Accounts/authentication, sessions.
- Latency compensation for actions (server-authoritative).
- Persistence: save world & characters to disk.
